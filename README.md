# AI Lab — Local-First AI for Education

Understand AI. Don’t worship it.

AI Lab is an offline-first, private-by-design AI learning environment built for classrooms and curious minds. Unlike productivity-focused AI assistants, AI Lab is designed to be **dismantled, understood, and controlled**.

## 🚀 Vision & Manifesto

We believe AI should be a **mirror, not a mind**. 

- **Beyond Speed**: We are not here to accelerate. We are here to make thinking visible again.
- **Built for Slowness**: We force intent to be explicit. Understanding replaces reaction.
- **Cognitive Infrastructure**: This is not just software; it's a foundation for independent thought.

## ✨ Features

- **Local-First Execution**: All models run on your hardware. No keys, no subscriptions, no hidden data flows.
- **Visible Reasoning**: Intermediate steps in AI logic are exposed, turning the "black box" into a transparent tool.
- **Pedagogy First**: No dark patterns or "growth hacks." Only systems that respect human cognition.
- **Privacy by Default**: We do not sell student data because we never see it.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Core**: HTML5, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Styling**: Modern CSS3 (Custom Design System, Glassmorphism, Responsive Grid)
- **Animations**: Custom particle systems (`Canvas API`) and smooth scroll-snapping.
- **Deployment**: Static hosting ready.

## 🔒 Ethics & Privacy

- **Free for Educators & Individual Learners.**
- **No keys to your lab**: Local running means you are the owner.
- **No optimization for addiction**: No notifications, no loops, just utility.

Built with intent. From chaos to understanding.
